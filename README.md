# About Me

I’m Donia Batool, an AI-powered Web Developer & Agentic AI Engineer based in Karachi. I specialize in building scalable, intelligent web applications that integrate AI-driven automation and sustainable design principles. My toolkit includes:

- **Frontend & Full-Stack**: Next.js, TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, WordPress, Streamlit/Chainlit for interactive apps.
- **Backend & Integrations**: Supabase, FastAPI, Stripe, Nodemailer, EmailJS, ShipEngine, third-party APIs (weather, search).
- **AI & RAG Systems**: OpenAI Agent SDK, Pinecone, ChromaDB, LangChain, CrewAI, LLM optimization (Gemini, OpenAI, Grok, DeepSeek).
- **DevOps & Infrastructure**: Vercel, Netlify, exploring Docker & Kubernetes for containerized deployments.
- **UI/UX & Design**: Figma for pixel-perfect, accessible interfaces.
- **Context & Tools**: Extensive use of RunContextWrapper patterns, modular agent workflows (triage, handoffs), structured outputs with Pydantic, and tracing/debugging agent logic.

I’m currently a senior student in the Governor’s Initiative for Agentic AI and engaged in the Presidential AI Program, continuously learning and adding new experiments to my GitHub:

Notable projects:
- **Jinnah Iqbal Agentic Podcast**: An autonomous AI-driven podcast assistant.
- **Eggspert AI (Poultry RAG Chatbot)**, **Cupping RAG Bot**, **NUTRI_BOT**: Real-world retrieval-augmented chatbots.
- **OpenAI Agent Experiments**: Simple agents, multi-agent handoff flows, tracing, structured output demos.

I’m passionate about pushing the boundaries of AI-powered web solutions with a focus on sustainability and impact. Here on Medium, I share my experiments, insights, and tutorials around the OpenAI Agents SDK and related AI/web technologies. Feel free to connect:
